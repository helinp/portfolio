**Typographic Friezes â€“ *Meravigliosa Creatura***  

A series inspired by the songs of Gianna Nannini, blending expressive typography with musical symbols. The text, flowing along the curves of a musical score, interacts with light yellow color blocks in a minimalist aesthetic. A visual narrative that conveys the rhythm and emotional essence of the music.
