A selection of projects completed during my master’s degree, exploring various graphic, editorial and visual approaches.

### Fragments — Paul Auster
An experimental booklet combining excerpts from The Invention of Solitude with antique maps of New York. Graphic overlays of iconic Brooklyn viewpoints interact with the text. Focus on handwritten calligraphy, layout structure and the use of white space as rhythm.

### CD Covers — Contemporary Music
Graphic variations designed for listening contexts: minimalist typographic compositions, invisible grids, restrained visual storytelling and modular structures tailored to CD packaging.

### MAC’s — Children Visual
Poster created during an internship at the MAC’s museum, combining documentary photography with informative layout. A clear, direct tone for accessible communication across diverse audiences.
