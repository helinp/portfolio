**Layout refinement for 2024-2025**, maintaining a clear and legible design, enhanced with a more functional structure: date in the top right, practical information at the bottom, better use of empty space. Circular shapes are favored, echoing the visual identity. Bright primary and secondary colors, consistent use of vector illustrations for a dynamic and cohesive graphic language.

### **Finalistsâ€™ Concert 24-25**
A structured and bold poster, built on a dense, vertical typographic layout. Superimposition of flat yellow vector instruments on a white background, energized by a saturated cyan blue. A strong composition reflecting musical excellence and diversity.

### **La nuit, je chante!**
Central circular illustration (stylized flame) evoking warmth, intimacy, and light. Nocturnal atmosphere with a contrasting palette (navy, orange, cream) and fluid handwritten typography. A strong and poetic visual for a candlelit concert.

### **The Book of Secrets / The Station Waltz**
Dual illustration in yellow/blue bichrome: a steam train and a masked couple dancing. Narrative composition, balanced between movement and symmetry. The graphic style evokes a theatrical, retro-inspired imaginary world.
