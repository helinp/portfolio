### Posters â€“ Teatro Tirso de Molina (2012-2013)
Dark and theatrical identity to reflect the intimacy of the venue and the popular Roman spirit. Textured black background, luminous cabaret-style titles, and a red-gold palette for an elegant and warm ambiance. A balance between tradition and modernity in service of commedia dell'arte.
